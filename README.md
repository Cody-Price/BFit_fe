# BFit

### Introduction

BFit is an iOS social media based application built for people who would like to post/share meal plans, workouts and other fitness tips all while supporting eachother together in a fitness-only paradigm. 

This project was assigned to be completed in less than 10 days requiring communication between Front End and Back End engineers. My partners and I all decided to take on two new languages to complete this task.
